# Image-to-PDF-Converter
Python Program to convert Image to PDF file.
The PIL and the img2pdf modules were used to convert image files to PDF files.
There are five possible cases:
1. The user wants to store each image in a separate/distinct PDF file.
2. The user wants to store multiple images in a single PDF file.
3. The user wants the program to recognize the text in an image and store just the text in a PDF.
4. The user wants to take a picture/pictures from the webcam and then convert it/them into a PDF file, or to recognize the text from the taken image and store it in a PDF file.
5. The user wants to resize/rotate/greyscale the image.

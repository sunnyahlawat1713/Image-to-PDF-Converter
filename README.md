# Image-to-PDF-Converter
Python Program to convert Image to PDF file.
The PIL and the img2pdf modules were used to convert image files to PDF files.
There are two possible cases:
1. The user wants to store each image in a separate/distinct PDF file.
2. The user wants to store multiple images in a single PDF file.
